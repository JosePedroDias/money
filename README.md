# PLAN

## CORE

* rename fields to generic names in English
* (if anyone cares) add support for other portuguese bank formats


## APPLICATIONS

* sort/filter by criteria
* tag movements
* try to learn tagging by human provided examples (fields and frequency they appear)
* provide simple HTTP server for these


## MAYBE, IF I EVER GET HERE

* simple analysis
    * cash flow through time
    * absolute/percent of money spent on stuff
